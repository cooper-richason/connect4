# Connect4 Game in R

## Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect4 game in R. I built this game as a fun project to work with matrices, loops, and coding strategies for the computer. Connect Four is a two-player game where the goal is to connect4 of your tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. This is a single-player version, against the computer.

## Features
- Play against a computer AI.
- Interactive interface for a user-friendly experience.
- Graphic display of game using plot

## Getting Started
To run the game, you will need R installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the files as a ZIP archive.

2. Open your R environment (RStudio or your preferred R IDE).

3. Open the `connect4.R` file in your R environment.

4. Run the script, and the game will start in the R console.

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 6x7 grid.
- Players take turns dropping their colored tokens into the columns.
- The first player to connect four tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, wins the game.

## Acknowledgments
- Thanks to the R community and the creators of Connect4 for inspiration.
